# BEEGND4 (Berlin Experimental and Educational Ground Station) 

**Systems Engineer**  

As part of TU Berlin‚Äôs competition team, I worked on the design and development of a planetary rover for the ERC. I was responsible for:

- Designing and manufacturing the rover chassis using SolidWorks:
  - Manufacturing was simplified by using pre fabricated aluminium profiles and attaching corners to form a rectangular frame as the main body. 
  - Volume was selected based on internal components, wiring and desired temperature inside the rover's body. 

- Performing structural simulations in Ansys Workbench for the robotic arm components

- Supporting the integration of the robotic arm with mechanical interface and mounting

- Participating in the system assembly and on-site testing

üèÜ **Result:** Working Ground station with improved mechanical properties.

üõ†Ô∏è **Tools used:** SolidWorks, FreeCAD, RF
