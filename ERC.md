# European Rover Challenge (ERC ’23 & ’24)

**Team Member – Mechanical Design**  

**Kielce, Poland – 2023 / Krakow, Poland – 2024**

As part of TU Berlin’s competition team, I worked on the design and development of a planetary rover for the ERC. I was responsible for:

- Designing and manufacturing the rover chassis using SolidWorks:
  - Manufacturing was simplified by using pre fabricated aluminium profiles and attaching corners to form a rectangular frame as the main body. 
  - Volume was selected based on internal components, wiring and desired temperature inside the rover's body. 

- Performing structural simulations in Ansys Workbench for the robotic arm components

- Supporting the integration of the robotic arm with mechanical interface and mounting

- Participating in the system assembly and on-site testing

🏆 **Result:** Achieved 7th place among 30+ international teams in 2024.

🛠️ **Tools used:** SolidWorks, Ansys Workbench, 3D printing, aluminum profile construction
